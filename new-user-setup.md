# ACCESS CI New User Account Setup


Welcome new ACCESS CI user! You should have received your ACCESS ID (a.k.a.,
username) from your local system administrator. However, there are several
steps you need to take before you can use your account.

## Read and accept the ACCESS CI Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
Visit <https://access-ci.org/acceptable-use/> and read the ACCESS CI
Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). You must agree to this policy in order to use
ACCESS CI resources. If you do not agree to the AUP, please inform your
local system administrator so they can delete your account.

An email will be sent to your registered address. 

Allow at least 5 minutes to receive the email. Be sure to check your Inbox
and Spam/Junk folders. If you do not receive it, it’s possible that your
school is blocking emails from our system. Please send email to
support@access-ci.atlassian.net with your ACCESS ID for assistance.

## Enroll in Duo

On your first login, you will be required to enroll in Duo for ACCESS.
[Install the Duo security
app](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app#download) on your phone and configure it to use
[Duo Mobile / Duo Push](https://guide.duo.com/universal-prompt#duo-push).
We do not recommend the [Phone
Call](https://guide.duo.com/universal-prompt#phone-call) option as it is
unreliable.
 
Click the “Get Started” button to begin the process.
